# PSC151V Creative Project

## Background
For my final project for PSC151V at UC Davis, I had to explain my favorite concept from the course to future students in an engaging and informative way. The concept that I chose to explain was [schemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)).


## Video lecture
If you don't want to read this `README`, then check out this short video I made for the assignment submission.


## What are schemas?
You can learn more about schemas from this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)), but essentially, schemas are mental blueprints that we use to organize and make meaning of information. For example, in the following image:

You see a picture of a dog, and your brain automatically recognizes it as a dog. It does not spend time checking if it has all the attributes of a dog (e.g: fur, four legs, nose, etc.). This is the basic premise behind schemas.

## What is my creative project and how does it relate to schemas?
For my creative project, I decided to make a game which demonstrates the idea of schemas to the player. Players are presented with an image like the following:
![Game Example](https://imgur.com/oebIU8P.png)

Players then must answer the question presented with four possible options within 3 seconds. There are three possible questions that can be asked of the player:
- What is the color being described by the text?
- What is the color of the text?
- What is the color of the background?

The relevance of my creative project to schemas is that the player must overcome the schema that their brain has when they see either the color of the background, the color of the text, and the word of some color to quickly figure out the answer. It can be fairly challenging, so I encourage you to give it a try.

## What technologies did I use for this project?
Since this was a fairly simply project, I only used [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

## How can you play?
I have hosted the game on Heroku [here](https://schema-game.herokuapp.com), so feel free to play.

## What's the future for this project?
I likely will not make any more additions or changes to the project unless there's a bug. If you have an idea and want to implement it, please feel free to clone this repo. Here are some ideas that I had but couldn't implement due to lack of time:
- Keep track of all user's score with a database
- Allow user to change how many questions they see and how much time per question they have
- Instead of multiple choice answers, have an input box where players must type their answer.
